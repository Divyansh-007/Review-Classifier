# Review Classifier
In this project with the help of Yelp Review Data from Kaggle and Natual Language Processing, we will attempt to classify reviews into 1 star or 5 stars based on text content in the review.
Although it is not required we will also utilize the pipeline method to include TF-IDF term in text processing and compare the performance.

Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.
The "stars" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review.

The "cool" column is the number of "cool" votes this review received from other Yelp users.
All reviews start with 0 "cool" votes, and there is no limit to how many "cool" votes a review can receive. In other words, it is a rating of the review itself, not a rating of the business.
The "useful" and "funny" columns are similar to the "cool" column.
